			<h2>My summer at Basecamp</h2>
		</header>

		<section class="project">
			<p>Hi, there! I'm Ben, one of the first Basecamp interns. I joined the company in May, after moving to Chicago from northwest Arkansas. Jason and I had met briefly last summer, and had exchanged a few emails since. During my first visit, we talked about some of my side projects, and I mentioned that I had an interest in both product design and running my own business. We spoke again in the spring, and decided to try working together this summer.</p>
			<p>My role wasn't strictly that of a business intern or design intern. I spent some of my time talking to Basecamp customers about their experience with the product, and some of my time pairing off with designers to try new concepts. This was an ideal arrangement for me; It allowed me to sharpen a variety of skills and learn from a lot of talented people.</p>
			<p>The discussions with customers gave me a better understanding of the people who use Basecamp. I learned that we were doing a lot of things right, but that there were some situations where Basecamp could do more to help people get things done. These were the situations I tried to keep in mind as I began working with our design team. They informed my decision making, and kept my focus on what mattered â€” the people who use our product day-in and day-out.</p>
			<p>I was fortunate to collaborate with two members of our design team, Jamie and Jonas, over the course of the summer. The experience of quickly iterating on a design was invaluable. It's so different from working alone, and I found I was making better decisions when I knew I'd have to fight for them. I also learned the importance of copy in design. A background color here or a border there isn't going to change the fact that the words are wrong. By the end of the internship, most of my design time was spent writing or editing.</p>
			<p>Halfway through the summer, I had an idea for a fundamental rethinking of Basecamp. I had been inspired by some of the customer interviews, and had taken a few days to prototype something on my own. Jason sat with me for an hour asking questions and providing the occasional bit of feedback. He's got a great product sense, and I often found the questions to be as valuable as his suggestions. If I had trouble answering a question, I knew I needed to spend more time thinking about that part of the flow. It was incredible to learn from one of my product heroes, and I think I grew a lot during our time together.</p>
			<p>Soup to nuts, the summer was a blast. I was doing real work with some of the best people in software, and I learned a ton. Special thanks to Jason, Jamie, and Jonas for all of their help. I hope they enjoyed it as much as I did. There's something truly special about learning in this way, and I recommend it to anyone interested in crafting a great product.</p>
