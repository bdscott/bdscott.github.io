				<p>After my second year of high school, I moved from a school of 500 students to a school four times that size. The whole experience &mdash; soup to nuts &mdash; was overwhelming. The wait for lunch was 25 minutes, which ate more than half of my lunch period. My third day of waiting in line, I decided to do something about it. <br><br>I began spending evenings and weekends creating YummmBox, an app to help students take back their lunch period. By placing orders earlier in the day (or the night before), when the cafeteria was less busy, students could avoid the lunch line entirely. Their food was hot and ready in a special "YummmBox pickup area." <br><br>I did all design and development for the iPhone app and web app. I also designed all of the app's marketing materials. A selection of work has been included below.</p>

				<p>This is Summit &mdash; a fundamental rethinking of Basecamp. I wanted to kill a lot of the assumptions we had made about how people work, and create a tool that was more freeform. <br><br>No more poring through multiple projects to find something &mdash; everything is in one place. You can organize your conversations, notes, and tasks by creating "labels," but you don't have to. It's as organized as you'd like it to be. <br><br> Anything in Summit can be shared easily, even with people outside your organization, and anything outside of Basecamp can easily be emailed in.

					<br><br>(<strong>Disclaimer</strong>: This was a design exploration that I undertook out of personal interest, and nothing more. This is not a future version of Basecamp.)</p>

				<p>Interviews are stressful. My team at HackMIT, a college hackathon, created moxy to prepare recent grads for their first interviews. <br><br> The idea was to anonymously connect recent grads with actual hiring managers at some of the world's best technology companies. They would set up a time and conduct a mock interview over the phone. <br><br>
				I did all design for moxy. My talented team mates took care of the backend.
